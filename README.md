# Financial Databases with SQL (Challenge #7 of FinTech Bootcamp)

In this challenge, I used SQL queries executed as pandas dataframes to analyze stock information held in a SQL databased.

## Technologies

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data structuring and analysis.

[numpy]

[hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) - For interactive visualizations

[sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) - For accessing SQL databased with python

## Lessons Learned

1- Performed key database operations (specifically, create, read, update, and delete operations) by using SQL.

2- Wrote advanced database queries by using SQL.

3- Built complete financial applications by using SQL and Python.
